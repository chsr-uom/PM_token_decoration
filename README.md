#### üìñ Abstract

**Background**: Amidst the climate crisis and persistent financial strain on the global healthcare system, it is imperative to prioritize cost estimation across the entire care continuum rather than single interventional procedures. Process mining for estimating aggregate costs, also referred to as cost mining, has shown promising initial results, but process maps remain descriptive and difficult to interpret. Methods that generate actionable information from real world data are therefore warranted.

**Methods**: We developed and tested a unique algorithm that leverages the powers of process mining to dynamically estimate total costs of care at the patient level, by incorporating and aggregating healthcare costs, and presenting these automatically on process maps as labels. We tested the feasibility of this method using a unique linked dataset of colorectal cancer pathways in Victoria, Australia covering 4,246 linked patient records collected between 2012-2020 and detailing their entire colorectal cancer pathway.

**Results**: The aggregated cost estimates generated by the algorithm enabled case-mix group comparisons and the exploration of inefficient, costly, or undesirable patient pathways. The combined registry data captures a total economic burden of $ 60,63M AUD, and per-patient costs ranged from $10,379 AUD to $41,643 AUD per stage of treatment. Admitted episodes were most costly, next to chemotherapy episodes. The analysis revealed large differences between stage D patients receiving specific chemotherapy regimens.

**Conclusion**: Cost mining is a feasible method for aggregating total patient level costs. This is particularly relevant to medical decision makers and healthcare policy because it not only uncovers cost sources but may also inform bundled payment initiatives.  The core limitations of this method relate to the current global dispersed and fractured health data infrastructure, which necessitates extensive manual linking of data. We provide suggestions for hospitals and policymakers looking to improve their health data infrastructure to enable real time patient level cost mining.
